            About Helen Manente Yoga</h1>
        <p className="about-text">Hello there! I’m Helen, and I teach yoga in and around Gravesend, Kent.</p>
        <p className="about-text">I’m also a professional flute player and teacher, and mum to my three gorgeous sons! I love Tolkien (understatement…), Haribo and red wine, as well as hiking (very slowly, according to my husband), writing and reading.</p>
        <p className="about-text">Yoga has been part of my life since I was a teen, when my mum and I tried very unsuccessfully to copy the photos in a book I found called ‘Yoga for You’! I’ve practised on-and-off during various periods of my life, but it wasn’t until I had the second of my three sons that I felt I’d ‘found’ yoga, or more accurately, yoga ‘found’ me.</p>
        <p className="about-text">A brutal bout of pregnancy insomnia which lasted not just for the pregnancy, but for a number of years, led me to start taking my yoga practice seriously. And in 2021, after a lot of soul-searching as to whether yoga teacher training was right for me, I decided to go for it, and started a 500 hour Diploma with the British Wheel of Yoga under the tuition of Belinda Emberson.</p>
        <p className="about-text">It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made! Not always easy – the course is rigorous, thorough and expects very high standards of academic and practical work – I felt challenged and inspired for the first time in years.</p>
        <p className="about-text">It awoke something in me that I had always been sceptical of – my spiritual side. Whilst I don’t mean this in a religious or New Age sense, I’ve come to recognise my own spirituality as an awareness of what makes me ‘me’. The ability to question and stand up for my values, the self-awareness to become more empathetic and emotionally mature. To better discern what is the essence of me and what is ego.</p>
        <p className="about-text">This depth is something I endeavour to bring to my classes. Yoga is so much more than postures, the philosophy underpinning the practice focuses on balance in body and mind. Something which we could all use more of, right?</p>
        <p className="about-text">And hatha yoga, the style of yoga I teach, is particularly accessible and beneficial. I plan everything in stages, so that everyone who attends finds their own version of the pose or breathing exercise to work at – layering complexity so that those who are complete beginners aren’t overwhelmed by the techniques I’m teaching to those who have been coming for a while!</p>
        <p className="about-text">I teach in a wide range of environments, from busy gyms, to campsites in the middle of the woods. I’m also part of a project at the Royal Academy of Music which aims to support their Postgraduate students with yoga, mindset and meditation.</p>
        <p className="about-text">As a musician myself, the chance to combine the two loves of my life has been something I’m especially excited about. I regularly hold sessions where I play live music at the end of my classes, I run instrumental sound baths with local practitioners, as well as a wonderful project, combining movement and breathwork with a live string quartet. On the flip side, I’m a huge heavy metal fan and one of my offerings is a session sequenced to a heavy metal soundtrack at one of Kent’s most iconic metal venues. I’ve also recently started a collaboration with Plant Based Kitchens, called Mindful Meetings, where we organise social events for those who love yoga, good food, music and nature.

        <p className="about-text">Hopefully some of this will have resonated with you. I am a firm believer in ‘what you see if what you get’! Some one who is passionate about bringing this powerful and transformative practice to as many people as possible. Someone who is constantly seeking to deepen and extend their knowledge of all aspects of yoga so that they can enrich their students’ experience. But someone who isn’t afraid to admit they can’t do it all yet, and still falls over. A lot.</p>
