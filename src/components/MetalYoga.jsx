            <p className="classes-text">Once a month I take over one of Kent’s iconic live music venues, Leo’s Red Lion in Gravesend, and put on a yoga class to a heavy metal soundtrack.</p>
            <p className="classes-text">I love yoga, and I love heavy metal, so combining the two is a no-brainer! These sessions include everything that I offer in my regular classes, with the addition of shouty, screamy music. They are a place where people from the alt community can come and feel welcome. A place where yoga doesn’t always mean love and light. A place to come as you are, and where you leave feeling stronger, freer and unapologetically real.</p>
            <p className="classes-text">These classes are in association with Heavy Metal Therapy, who offer peer support to the alternative community, helping people who are struggling with mental health. 50% of profits from these classes are donated to them - please <a>check out their work!</a>.</p>
