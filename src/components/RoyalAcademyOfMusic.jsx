            <p className="classes-text">These classes are part of the Enhanced Performance Techniques module on offer for Postgraduates at The Royal Academy of music. They aim to support students at the start of their careers, offering practical solutions to the many physical, mental and emotional issues faced by young musicians.</p>
            <p className="classes-text">The yoga element has a multi-faceted focus: Postures and exercises to ease aches and pains for the specific problems that are reported by classical musicians. Pranayama to help encourage healthy breathing patterns and consciously control the breath in order to counteract performance anxiety. Meditation to increase focus and concentration for when it matters most! And relaxation to aid with burnout and stress relief.</p>
