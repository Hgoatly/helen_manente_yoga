            <p className="classes-text">Movement, Music and Meditation sessions â€“ the perfect blend of yoga class and flute recital.</p>
            <p className="classes-text">For me, music has always been a source of focus, balance and an outlet to express my innermost self. Whether I'm listening or performing, music of many genres has a profound effect on me, whether that's eliciting excitement, elation, calm, sadness, anger or anywhere in between.</p>
            <p className="classes-text">And since I started practising yoga in the same depth as music, the two have become synonymous. I feel the same sense of focus and balance in the physical practice, and the philosophy has allowed me to start to find that innermost self that for a long time was totally hidden.</p>
            <p className="classes-text">The opportunity to share this with you all in a class which offers the benefits of movement, meditation and relaxation through music is something I've been dreaming of for many years.</p>
